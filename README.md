## Repository Structure
This repository contains the datasets and scripts used to generate the figures in our analysis of **scRNA-seq denoising** using **(DCA, ENHANCE, MAGIC, SAVER)** and **WAVDESC** the tool we propose.

## Background
WAVDeSc leverages biorthogonal wavelet transforms to decompose scRNA-seq data into different frequency components and applies Bayesian thresholding to remove noise. The pipeline comprises three main phases: Signal Decomposition, Thresholding, and Signal Reconstruction aimed at producing a denoised scRNA-seq output. The approach enables the recovery of technical zeros and enhances quality while preserving important biological signals and improving downstream analyses.  

## Workflow
The diagram below outlines the end-to-end workflow of the WAVDesC pipeline, highlighting its main processing steps and data flow from initial preprocessing to final output.

## Datasets
All simulated and real datasets used and the denoised dataseted generated by the WAVDesC pipeline and the other denoising pipelines are stored in the [`datasets/`](datasets/) directory.*

**Slightly more descriptive:**

* *All input datasets and intermediate results generated during the WAVDesC workflow are organized in the [`data/`](link-to-directory) directory for easy access.*

Do you want me to make it sound more **formal (like a methods section)** or **practical (like a usage guide)**?
